HEAP
min heap and max heap
min heap: always have minimum element on the root 
heap is also a complete tree : all the level are filled except last. The nodes of last level filled from left to right so the complexity of insertion and deletion :O(logN)
N=number of nodes


our question is to calculate the height of heap which is log2(N)

class Solution{

    static int heapHeight(int N, int arr[]){
        // code here
        int count=0;
        while(N != 1){
            N=N/2;
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
